My strategic thinking, combined with mathematical skills and engineering knowledge, has allowed me to create my own career path. I focus on key results, quickly adapt to new insights and teams, and conceptualize rapidly.</p>
        
        <p>Open to learning new things and taking on new challenges, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of innovation in the automobile industry. Currently specializing in passive safety, I recently led a kickbox micromobility innovation project, where I played a pivotal role in innovation project leadership and more.
